						<h3>South Africa the art of a nation</h3>
						
						<p>Some of the world's oldest artworks were created in southern Africa 100,000 years ago. The present-day nation of South Africa has a powerful contemporary art scene, one that draws inspiration from this deep past, as well as more recent events, to comment on the present.</p>
						<p>This exhibition juxtaposes historic and contemporary artworks to tell a history of South Africa from the earliest artistic acts to the most recent. It highlights the many peoples that have contributed to making the art of the nation of South Africa.</p>

						<strong>Rock art is one of South Africa's oldest artistic traditions.</strong>

						<h2>Ancient art, new media</h2>

                        <p>Rock art was first made by the ancestors of San|Bushmen and Khoekhoen, South Africa's first peoples, at least 30,000 years ago.</p>

                        <p>The tradition did not survive the impact of European colonisation in the late 1800s, but rock art is now an important part of South Africa's post-apartheid national identity. The central figures in the South African coat of arms are from the Linton Panel, the most famous example of rock art in South Africa, and the national motto is written in /Xam, a now extinct San|Bushman language:</p>
                        
                        <p>KE E : /XARRA //KE – Diverse People Unite</p>

                        <p>Although rock art is no longer made, descendants of San|Bushmen and Khoekhoen continue to make artworks based on their historical traditions.</p>

	                    <p>The joining of the names 'San|Bushmen', which refers to men and women, reflects the political complexities of collective naming, where both 'San' and 'Bushman' are considered derogatory by some but have been positively adopted by others. Lines such as / and ! before certain words represent sounds not present in the Latin alphabet.</p>

									<h3>Zaamenkomst Panel</h3>
									<p>Artist names unrecorded, before AD 1900</p>
									<p>This rock painting depicts San|Bushmen running between eland, a type of antelope that is spiritually important. Hunter-gatherer-fisher rock paintings such as this are understood to relate to a ritual practice named 'the great healing' or 'trance dance', which continues in the Kalahari today.</p>									
									<p>The paintings address the relationship between healers, or shamans, and the worlds of the living and the dead. In the painting some eland are bleeding from the nose and frothing at the mouth. Eland do this when they are close to death, and shamans show similar symptoms when they are metaphorically 'dying' and entering the world of the dead during the trance dance.</p>

									At first the sun was a sleeping man. In his house on earth, he shone for himself only. The earth was cold and dark, and there was no way the people could dry the ant larvae to eat, so the old woman called the children to her: <q>Creep up to that old man the sun while he is sleeping, and throw him into the sky while he feels hot. Instruct him to take his place in the sky, so he can shine for the whole world, so we can dry our rice, so we can feel warm, so the earth is bright.</q>

									<p>Here an ancient San|Bushman story has been depicted in a contemporary textile. It shows the creation of the sun and is based on a story recorded in 1871 by two linguists, Wilhelm Bleek and Lucy Lloyd. The story was originally told to them by //Kabbo a /Xam shaman who was imprisoned in Cape Town for a petty crime and was then transferred into their custody so that they could record the language and culture of San|Bushmen. //Kabbo and others helped them to record 12,000 pages of /Xam customs. Today this archive is one of the main sources for understanding San|Bushman rock art.</p>

						<strong>Our ability to think and act using symbols – and to make art as a result – is an integral part of being human.</strong>

						<h2>From origins to early art</h2>

						<p>In South Africa the development of artistic activity has left a visible trace of our evolution, establishing it as one of the places where our ancestors first became fully human.</p>

						<p>The story begins around three million years ago, with objects that were collected and valued for their appearance, continuing in the deliberate shaping of objects to make them aesthetically pleasing, forerunners of true artistic traditions that began 100,000 years ago.</p>

						<p>From at least 77,000 years ago, people began to decorate objects and their own bodies and, eventually, to produce two-dimensional paintings and engravings of humans and animals.</p>

						<p>This archaeological evidence identifies South Africa as one of the cradles of humankind, and is an important part of the country's national identity</p>

									<h3>The Makapansgat Pebble</h3>
									<p>Collected about 3 million years ago</p>
									<p>The Makapansgat Pebble is an early piece of evidence for hominid curiosity. It was found in a cave with the remains of early human ancestors, <strong>Australopithecus africanus</strong>, which date to 3 million years ago. The stone is not from the cave but was brought there from a site many kilometres away.</p>
									<p>It was not used as a tool but was perhaps valued and kept by its collector because the natural features on both sides look like faces, which were aesthetically pleasing. This could be called 'found art', a practice that many contemporary artists employ today.

								<h3>Kathu Pan handaxe</h3>
								<p>Maker's name unrecorded, about a million years ago</p>
								<p>The distinctive banded ironstone of this handaxe has been shaped to make it symmetrical and thin, a process requiring time and skill. It is too thin to be practical for everyday use, suggesting that people were making objects to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
								<p>We now know that human brains are attracted to symmetry: perhaps the maker of the handaxe was tapping into this preference, to create a tool that would attract attention. It would also communicate skill, good eyesight and an ability to source material and plan ahead.<p>

								<h3>Blombos Cave shell beads</h3>
								<p>Artist names unrecorded, about 75,000–78,000 years ago</p>
								<p>These shell beads from Blombos Cave are coloured with red ochre and each has a hole in it, suggesting they were strung together and worn as a necklace. They are among the world's earliest evidence of body decoration. Ochre is earth or rock that has a high concentration of iron, and has been used for tens of thousands of years as an ingredient for paint.</p>
								<p>Other objects from Blombos Cave included ochre that was itself engraved with patterns, engraved bone points, and red ochre paint-making kits. Together these objects represent part of the world's earliest artistic tradition, which began 100,000 years ago, and support the argument that southern Africa is one of the locations where modern human behaviour began.<p>

								<h3>Coldstream Stones</h3>
								<p>Artist name unrecorded, about 9,000 years ago</p>
								<p>In this elegant rock painting, the artist used red and white ochre to depict three human figures. They are amazingly well-preserved. The stone, known as the Coldstream Stone after the place where it was found, is one of the earliest known pieces of two-dimensional figurative art from South Africa. The central figure is carrying what looks like hunting equipment, including a sheath of arrows over one shoulder.</p>
								<p>The figures are also shown with blood streaming from their noses. Based on San|Bushmen traditions, it is possible they are shamans involved in a 'trance' or 'healing' dance.</p> 
								<p>The Coldstream Stone was found placed on top of a 9,000-year-old human burial, which tells us that rock art had a ritual use at that time.<p>

								<h3>Quagga</h3>
								<p>Artist name unrecorded, about 2,000 years ago</p>
								<p>A quagga is a sub-species of Plains Zebra that became extinct in the 1800s. Here an artist has engraved a quagga on a piece of rock – a form of rock art known as a petroglyph. The creature's hair is raised on the back of its neck, a common feature in rock art relating to the San|Bushmen ritual 'trance' or 'healing' dance. It may reflect the way hairs stand up on a hunted animal's neck as it dies and the comparable feeling that shamans experience as they enter a state of trance.</p>

						<strong>Fossil remains of human ancestors and evidence of a deep artistic past identify South Africa as a cradle of humankind.</strong>

						<h2>A cradle of humankind</h2>

						<p>The deep artistic past is important in contemporary South Africa because it identifies the country as one of the locations where modern human behaviour began. Archaeological evidence also shows it as one of the places where the modern human body developed.</p>
						<p>This means that we are all descended from Africa, both in terms of our bodily structure and in the way that we act, think and feel. The findings are an important challenge to Eurocentric interpretations of world history.</p>
						<p>Some contemporary artists have found inspiration in the celebration of southern Africa as one of the places where modern humans evolved.</p>

									<h3>Taung, 1985</h3>
									<p>This computer-generated image was created for a poster celebrating the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the skull of a 2.5 million-year-old child, known as the Taung Child. This young Australopithecine was a member of the same species of early human ancestor as the individual who collected the Makapansgat Pebble, on display in this section of the exhibition.</p>
									<p>The discovery of the Taung Child provided evidence that humanity's earliest ancestors evolved first in Africa and not in Europe as previously believed. Nel has a long-held interest in the interface between art and science and his image drew upon the most advanced computer technology of the time. It subtly links the skills of the palaeontologist, the artist and the computer software designer.</p>

									<h3>Potent Fields, 2002</h3>
									<p>Nel created these two planes of red and white ochre following the discovery of 77,000-year-old engraved red ochre at Blombos Cave on the southern coast of South Africa. Nel uses ochre to allude to the long history of artistic production in South Africa, including the making of rock art. The ochre also has relevance for the country's more recent history.</p>
									<p>The division of the red and white refers to the colour divide of apartheid, but because the ochre was collected from the Eastern Cape Province where Nelson Mandela was born and grew up, it also acknowledges the potential for a colour balance in post-apartheid South Africa.</p>

						<strong>The first works of sculpture in South Africa were made around 1,500 years ago.</strong>

						<h2>First sculptures</h2>

						<p>Around 1,500 years ago, Bantu-speaking people migrated into southern Africa. Today the descendants of those migrants make up the majority of the South African population, including the Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, South Sotho, North Sotho, Ndebele, Tsonga, Tswana and Venda peoples.</p>
						<p>The new arrivals created permanent settlements, grew crops and herded cattle, sheep and goats, and brought with them new technologies, such as metalworking. They also took part in an international trade network that stretched across the Indian Ocean. Their wealth led to the creation of the first kingdom in southern Africa.</p>
						<p>These societies used sculptures to assert their values, for instance during ceremonies that marked rites of passage. The sculptures are part of the evidence of complex societies in South Africa before the arrival of Europeans.</p>

									<h3>Lydenburg Head</h3>
									<p>Artist name unrecorded, AD 500–900</p>
									<p>This ceramic head is one of the earliest examples of figurative sculpture in southern Africa. It was found buried with six others near Lydenburg, and could have been worn as a mask in initiation ceremonies.</p>
									<p>The masks may reflect the styles adopted by that community, suggesting that they decorated themselves by scarring their faces and filing or removing their teeth.</p>
									<p>The shape of the eyes resembles cowrie-shells, which may indicate that the artists were familiar with objects from the eastern African coastline 300 km away in what is today Mozambique.</p>

									<p>Figurative sculptures from this period are normally associated with Bantu-speakers, but the Kenilworth Head is a reminder that South Africa's first peoples may also have made figurative sculpture and that there is still much to discover about pre-colonial art in South Africa.</p>

									<p>These artworks were discovered alongside hundreds of gold objects, including bracelets and beads, at Mapungubwe. Gold was mined in the regions around Mapungubwe and traded with the coast as part of a wider international network, and became a status symbol for the kingdom's rulers.</p>

						<strong>Europeans claimed that when they arrived South Africa was an 'empty land'.</strong>

						<h2>Terra nullius – the myth of an 'empty land'</h2>

						<p>From 1948 the South African government introduced laws that enforced a system of racial segregation known as apartheid, meaning 'separateness'. An official version of history was promoted during this period to justify white rule, which stated that South Africa had been an 'empty land' before European settlement in 1652.</p>
						<p>In fact South African art shows that people existed in South Africa long before European settlement. Although many of the sculptures in this section were known to exist, they were not included in official histories promoted by the apartheid state.</p>
						<p>The contemporary works here express a need to challenge the false ideas sanctioned by apartheid rule.</p>
